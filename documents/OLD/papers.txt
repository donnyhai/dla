Stabilization of DLA in a wedge
We consider Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) in a two-dimensional wedge. We prove that if the angle of the wedge is smaller than π/4, there is some a>2 such that almost surely, 
for all R large enough, after time Ra all new particles attached to the DLA will be at distance larger than R from the origin.

scaling a model of witten-sander-type
Summary: We try to prove rigorously that the perimeter of the large Witten-Sander cluster does not scale as the square root of its area, by making a forced comparison with the ill-posed 
Hele-Shaw problem of fluid dynamics. The attempt is not completely successful; nevertheless some interesting consequences of the comparison are derived.

Summary: Fourier and wavelet transforms of fractal objects show specific scaling properties from which fractal dimensions may be deduced. When applied to Witten and Sander aggregates, 
these two techniques, in their optical and numerical versions, give conflicting results. We describe and hopefully explain these contradictions.

Summary: We use the wavelet transform microscope to explore the intricate geometry of fractal aggregates. We show that the statistical self-similarity of Witten and Sander diffusion 
limited aggregates (DLA) is related to the existence of a predominant structural five-fold symmetry. We report on the discovery of Fibonacci sequences in the DLA morphology with a 
branching ratio which converges to the golden mean.
